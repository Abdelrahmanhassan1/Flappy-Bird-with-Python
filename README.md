#### This game was recreated using python.
User only tap on the space button and the bird shouldn't collise with the pipes or both the top and bottom of the screen
Score and High Score exist to iterate the user play.
User can change the size of the window by changing the variables WIN_WIDTH, WIN_HEIGHT.
Everything is flexible as created with variables not hard coded.
