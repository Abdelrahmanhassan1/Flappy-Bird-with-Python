#### This game was recreated using python.

The user only taps on the space button and the bird shouldn't collide with the pipes or both the top and bottom of the screen.<br>
Score and High Score exist to iterate the user play. <br>
Users can change the size of the window by changing the variables WIN_WIDTH, WIN_HEIGHT. Everything is flexible as created with variables not hardcoded.<br>

## This game was done in some steps:<br>
1. First uploading the images and surfaces of the game.<br>
2. Adding the bird and its movement.<br>
3. Adding the pipes and how it recreates randomly at different heights while the game continues.<br>
4. The Collisions of birds with the pipes and the top and the bottom of the window.<br>
5. Rotating and Animating the bird to make it like a real bird flapping.<br>
6. The score and high score rendered.<br>
7. The game over the window and the sounds.<br>
